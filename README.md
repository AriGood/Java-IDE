TODO LIST

Fri 8 Nov

    [] Use cases described for each user story and user interations identified (each interaction becomes an Interactor with a Controller and Presenter)
    [] All the Views sketched by hand (or using a software tool like Figma or your favourite drawing program)
    [] A first "team use case" implemented, tested, and pushed to repo
        Your team should have a minimal program which you can demo for your TA in the following lab 
    [] Entities decided on: what's the data you need to manipulate from your problem domain?
    [] Be able to make calls to the API your team has chosen.

Fri 15 Nov

    [] All View and View Model code written except for actionPerformed methods
        Pair program for this so that two people know the details of each View and View Model.
    [] In-memory data access objects created although perhaps not yet implemented to facilitate testing
    [] Builder written that creates the views — run the program and make sure each view looks okay (you might edit the build method between runs to show a different view or create multiple main classes / methods)
    [] Code for individual use cases begun with at least one unit test per Interactor

Fri 22 Nov

    [] Use cases mostly complete and test coverage over 75% for code in the Use Case and Entity layers
        You don't need to test your Controllers, Presenters, Views, View Models, or Data Access objects
    [] Be ready to demo your latest program to your TA in the next lab to get final feedback ahead of presentations!

Fri 29 Nov

    [] Team code review done to ensure Clean Architecture and that all user stories are implemented — refactor as needed!
    [] 100% test coverage for code in the Use Case and Entity layers.
    [] Team presentation drafted and practiced

Mon 2 Dec, Tue 3 Dec

    [] Team presentations during lab time (Tue is Makeup Monday)
        More details to be posted, but be ready to talk about and demonstrate the user story you were responsible for implementing + your team's overall experience     working on the project together!

Team story:
George creates a new Java file, opens it, writes some code on it, saves it and then closes it. He then opens it again and runs it. 
(edit as we go)

(Mark wants to make a Java program for his class. He opens the IDE and installs the addons needed for his program. 
He cloned a repository from git and opened the README file for instructions. 
After completing all TODOS, he staged, committed, and pushed his changes to the remote repository.)

Maria Burcea - marburcea:
Jennifer wants to be able to use an IDE that highlights her syntax and errors while she codes a Java program, 
and also provides her autocompletion options to simplify coding, and so she doesn’t have to re-type the same code.

Ari Good - arigood:
Bill wants to be able to use git within the IDE without using the terminal. 

Dario Sanchez - dariosanp:
Norbit wants to make a Java program for a client. He runs into an error during the coding process and uses the debugger to troubleshoot his code. He was able to see the values of his variables and
fixed his code so his customer was happy with the program.

Mariana Novoa - mariana-novoa:
Tracy wants to manage files and run Java programs directly through an integrated terminal, so that she can create, delete, and run files without leaving the IDE.

Yara Alkurdi - yaraalkurdi:
Jessica, while developing her Java program, wants to use a terminal within her IDE to run commands, navigate between directories, and view output directly in a terminal UI. This helps her efficiently interact with her project's environment without leaving the IDE.

Team story:
George creates a new Java file, opens it, writes some code on it, saves it and then closes it. He then opens it again and runs it. 
(edit as we go)

(Mark wants to make a Java program for his class. He opens the IDE and installs the addons needed for his program. 
He cloned a repository from git and opened the README file for instructions. 
After completing all TODOS, he staged, committed, and pushed his changes to the remote repository.)

Maria Burcea - marburcea:
Jennifer wants to be able to use an IDE that highlights her syntax and errors while she codes a Java program, 
and also provides her autocompletion options to simplify coding, and so she doesnâ€™t have to re-type the same code.

Ari Good - arigood:
Bill wants to be able to use git within the IDE without using the terminal. 

Dario Sanchez - dariosanp:
Norbit wants to make a Java program for a client. He runs into an error during the coding process and uses the debugger to troubleshoot his code. He was able to see the values of his variables and
fixed his code so his customer was happy with the program.

Mariana Novoa - mariana-novoa:
Tracy wants to manage files and run Java programs directly through an integrated terminal, so that she can create, delete, and run files without leaving the IDE.

Yara Alkurdi - yaraalkurdi:
Jessica, while developing her Java program, wants to use a terminal within her IDE to run commands, navigate between directories, and view output directly in a terminal UI. This helps her efficiently interact with her project's environment without leaving the IDE.

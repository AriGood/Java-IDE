#### Principle 1: Equitable Use  
- This program is easily usable for the average user without sight impairment.
- However, this program lacks accessibility options for those with vision impairment, going forward we would like to implement a text to speech function that would allow everyone to use the program. 
#### Principle 2: Flexibility in Use
- This program is quite rigid in its implementatition; it is meant to be used one way and can only be used in that way. Going forward, we would like to implement features that allow the IDE to be edited to each user's desires and preferences.
- This principle also does not really apply to our program as we have designed the IDE to be used as a regular IDE, which is also quite rigid in its implementation.  
#### Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use  
- The IDE has a fairly straight forward implementation that can be used by any user that can comfortably use a computer, and does not require advanced knowledge of any particular software. 
#### Principle 4: Perceptible Information  
- The perceptible information is whatever is input by the user or already available on the device running the IDE. 
#### Principle 5: Tolerance for Error  
- The IDE has a high tolerance for error, you can make changes to files in the editor without consequence and confirm changes using Git functionality in the terminal same as you would for IntelliJ.
- You can also open the wrong file or directory and go back on your changes, and close, open, and reopen tabs without making changes. 
#### Principle 6: Low Physical Effort
- The IDE requires very low physical effort and can be used by those who are not high energy.
#### Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use 
- This program does not require large space for running it. The program itself does not occupy much storage on a device and can be used like any other IDE on a computer.

#### Program Marketing  
Our program is marketed towards those who are starting to use technology and want to become more familiar with programming, without the use of a complicated IDE like IntelliJ or PyCharm. This simplified IDE allows users to practice coding and using Git functionality with a simplified interface. The simpler interface is marketed towards the older population that finds interfaces such as IntelliJ's too complicated and visually-daunting. This group of people may happen to be older adults (50+) who are interested in programming and software design, but want to start slowly with a simple interface. This could also be used by pre-teens who are learning to code and do not need a complex interface with unnecessary functionality. 

#### Demographics of Note
Our IDE is less likely to be used by a young adult demographic who already has experience with coding and software design, as the interface may be too simple for their needs. This program will also not be used by those with a visual impairment, as they cannot access the IDE. It will also not be used by those who have no computer usage experience, such as the elderly, who will find the manipulation of the computer interface, along with the IDE itself, too complex.

#### Principle 1: Equitable Use  
- This program is easily usable for the average user without sight impairment.
- However, this program lacks accessibility options for those with vision impairment, going forward we would like to implement a text to speech function that would allow everyone to use the program. 
#### Principle 2: Flexibility in Use
- This program is quite rigid in its implementatition; it is meant to be used one way and can only be used in that way. Going forward, we would like to implement features that allow the IDE to be edited to each user's desires and preferences.
- This principle also does not really apply to our program as we have designed the IDE to be used as a regular IDE, which is also quite rigid in its implementation.  
#### Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use  
- The IDE has a fairly straight forward implementation that can be used by any user that can comfortably use a computer, and does not require advanced knowledge of any particular software. 
#### Principle 4: Perceptible Information  
- The perceptible information is whatever is input by the user or already available on the device running the IDE. 
#### Principle 5: Tolerance for Error  
- The IDE has a high tolerance for error, you can make changes to files in the editor without consequence and confirm changes using Git functionality in the terminal same as you would for IntelliJ.
- You can also open the wrong file or directory and go back on your changes, and close, open, and reopen tabs without making changes. 
#### Principle 6: Low Physical Effort
- The IDE requires very low physical effort and can be used by those who are not high energy.
#### Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use 
- This program does not require large space for running it. The program itself does not occupy much storage on a device and can be used like any other IDE on a computer.
